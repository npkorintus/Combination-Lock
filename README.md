# Combination-Lock

This simple Java program simulates the way a combination lock works. When executed, the user is prompted by a menu to select one of six options:

1. Set lock combination
2. Close lock
3. Check status (locked or unlocked)
4. Attempt to open lock
5. Check which number dial is on
6. Exit program

Each number of the locks combination must be between 0-39 when a Lock object is created.

The program continues to run until terminated by the user.
